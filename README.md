# Machine-Learning
The second semester of 2021 (ML)

# Perceptron
Understand how NN works while implementing Perceptron Python class directly.<br>
It is possible to understand and explain the data preparation, development, learning, verification, and visualization process of the machine learning model.<br>

# MLP
Implemented using the pytorch mlp structure to understand and can be modified.<br>
Fashinon dimneoning, develop homegrown solutions to problems - mnist hyper tuning parameters can do it and understand the learning process.<br>

# SVM
A classifier for classifying linearly classifiable data may be learned using the SVM model.<br>
A model learning and verification process may be implemented using Scikit-Learn.<br>

# Clustering K-means
It can be understood while directly implementing the K-Means model.<br>
